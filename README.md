# Heart Failure Prediction


## Explanation of the project
_100 words to explain what your project is about to a general audience. _
This project is an attempt to accurately predict whether someone is at serious risk of heart failure.

## DATA

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

Cleveland: 303 observations
Hungarian: 294 observations
Switzerland: 123 observations
Long Beach VA: 200 observations
Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
Total: 1190 observations Duplicated: 272 observations

**Final dataset: 918 observations**

Every dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/
